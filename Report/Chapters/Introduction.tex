\chapter{Introduction}

Anartica is the coldest continent on Earth covered in a vast sheet of ice that contains about 30 million cubic kilometres of ice~\cite{NSIDC_ice_sheet_facts_2024} which is about 60\% of the world's fresh water.
This ice sheet is currently melting at an increasing rate due to global warming and other factors and scientists are trying to understand why.
One of the methods being used to analyse sea ice is drilling ice cores and analysing the ice for various properties from the concentration of gases to the concentration of dust particles.
One of the properties that is currently difficult to analyse is the salinity of the melted and solid sea ice.
This project aims to develop a system that can measure the salinity of the melted sea ice at the bottom of the ice cores mentioned. 

\section{Background}
\~ more about the project sea ice and what this analysis will help with.

\section{Objectives}
The objectives of this project are to create a device that is able to measure the salinity of sea ice at the bottom of ice cores.
The device should be able to measure the salinity of the ice in harsh conditions and cold environments that will be present in Antarctica.
The device should also be able to measure the salinity of the ice in a non-destructive manner so that the ice core can be used for other analysis after the salinity has been measured.

\section{Scope \& Limitations}
The scope of this project includes the design and development of a device that can measure the salinity of sea ice at the bottom of ice cores.
It includes the calibration of the devices, calculations for it, and establishing the accuracy of the device.
The scope does not include the capture and analysis of the data from the device.

It is limited to performing in the conditions of Anartica and measureing melted sea ice.
It is limited by a budget of R2000 for the full design and development of the device.
