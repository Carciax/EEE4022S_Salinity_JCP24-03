  abstract = {Weight-concentrated solutions of standard seawater P101 were used to measure conductivity ratio Rt and density ϱ(S, t, 0) for salinity (S) ranging from 35 to 50 and temperature (t) from 10 to 30°C. These data were fitted into third degree polynomials in temperature and salinity that give the salinity with a precision of ±3 × 10−3 and the density with a precision of ±4 × 10−3 kg m−3, from 42 to 50 salinity and 10 to 30°C. These polynomials are proposed to extend the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 and the Equation of State 1980.}
