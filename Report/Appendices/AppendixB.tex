    \textbf{GA} & \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Justification and section in the report}  \\
    1 & Problem-solving & This project solved the problem of designing a compact salinity meter which included circuit, \gls{pcb} and board-to-board communication design and embedded C coding in \refch{ch:design}. \\ 
    4 & Investigations, experiments and data analysis & This project investigating the properties of saltwater conductivity measurements and evaluated the performance of the probe in \refch{ch:testing}.\\
    5 & Use of engineering tools & This project used KiCad software to design and fabricate \glspl{pcb}, FreeCAD and PrusaSlicer to 3D print switch caps, and Microsoft Excel and MATLAB to conduct data analysis in \refch{ch:design},~\ref{ch:implementation} and~\ref{ch:testing} respectively.\\
    6 & Professional and technical communication & This project demonstrated professional and technical communication through the writing of a report covering the project. \\
    8 & Individual work & This report covers the individual report conducted by its author in the research, design, implementation and testing of a prototype salinometer in \refch{ch:literature},~\ref{ch:design},~\ref{ch:implementation} and~\ref{ch:testing} respectively. \\
    9 & Independent learning ability & This report demonstrates the independent learning ability its author through the research in \refch{ch:literature} conducted and applied to the design of a salinometer in addition to the iterative testing conducted in \refch{ch:testing}. \\
